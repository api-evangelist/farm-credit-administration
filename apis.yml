  The Farm Credit Administration, also known as the FCA, is an independent
  federal agency responsible for regulating and supervising the Farm Credit
  System, which is a nationwide network of cooperatively owned institutions that
  provide credit and financial services to farmers, ranchers, and other
  agricultural borrowers. The FCA ensures that the Farm Credit System operates
  in a safe and sound manner, provides fair and competitive services to its
  customers, and complies with applicable laws and regulations. The agency also
  conducts audits and examinations of Farm Credit institutions to assess their
  financial condition and compliance with regulatory requirements, as well as to
  identify any potential risks to the agricultural sector. Through its oversight
  and supervisory activities, the Farm Credit Administration helps to sustain
  the availability of affordable credit and financial services to support the
  agricultural industry and rural communities.
